# Requirements Explanation (If you want the short explanation, it would be below the long explanation)

1. In the end the website that I created meets the user requirements that the course gave us, and this is because of multiple reasons, e.g. one of them can be the design which can be supported by multiple devices such as phone design and computer design, another one can be navigation because it has a nav bar which is used to navigate thought the page and with this the user/visitor can go from a page to the page that we wants. Another few features of the website that meets the user requirements are = it loads quick, it meets the purpose meaning that the website is about a company of phone and accessories, it is easy to understand, it is proportionate to the device design, it is very easy to understand, the design is simple and professional that meets and suits the purpose of the website.

1. While making the website, multiple times I have stopped to check if what I was doing actually met the user requirements that the course has, meaning that at the end of making the website and testing it, if the website would have not met the user requirements then I would have to change the code and make it so it actually meets them however always the user requirements would also have to meet my design ideas so if them would meet then it would make the testing way easier for me and for the user/marker/tester.

2. Almost all the requirements that I have have listed before have met the website and my design, however as said before "almost all of them" have met the design and that it is because the requirement of "colourful" in the "## Visitor Requirements" did not meet the design/website and that is because my design idea of my website was to be mostly bland by using the white colour as background-colour (#ffffff) so that means that I could change the design however it did not seem professional if it had multiple colours (my design/website) so I have decided to not change it and leave it mostly bland. By using pictures, videos and buttons I was able to give some colour at the website however it is not enough to be called "colourful".

3. As said before apart of the "colourful" user requirement, all of them are met and that is because I have created my website having in my mind that I have to fulfil the user requirements and so I have done. One example of user requirement fulfilled is the "Client Requirements" which are all fulfilled and that is because: the "Professional, presenting good images at company" requirement is fulfil and that is because the website is designed to be professional and having good images of phone for the company, the "Accessibility" requirement is fulfilled because the website can be access anywhere and it can be used how you want, and the "Performance" requirement was fulfilled and that is because the website has a good performance e.g. it loads fast, it has no problems and it can be accessed easier and fast.

4. Another example of my website meeting the user requirements is in the "Visitor Requirements" because all of them (apart the "colourful" requirement) are met and that is because : the "Images of phones" requirement is met and that is because the website is about the company and that means that the website would have a good amount of pictures of phones and other accessories for phones, the "loads quickly" requirement is met and that is because the website was coded to become a fast and easy to use website meaning that I have put time into searching and testing multiple coding to see which one would be better for this idea of being fast and easy, the "easy to navigate" requirement, as said before, is met and that is because the website was coded and tested multiple times to make the website fast and easy to use in every way an example can be using the navbar. Another few examples of requirements meeting the website are the last 3 requirements from the Visitor Requirements and those are: the "proportion of the website" is met and that is because the website was made by taking in consideration the fact that I had to do a double design website and when I have put something in my website then I would convert the "thing" that I have added into my website to something that would fit the pc design and the phone design, the "easy to understand" is met because already from the design idea one of the most important requirements for me was the "easy to understand" so I have made my website based on that requirement; the "easy to access for everyone" requirement is one of the most important requirement for me and that is because I have designed my website to be able to access however the user decided and that is because if the user wants to use a smartphone than he can and that is because the website would "shrink" to make the website easier to use on smartphone.

5. Furthermore, another section of requirements that are met is the "Developer Requirements" and that is because: the "Clean, well-commented source code" requirement is well met and that is because the code is a easy to read and understand coding that anyone can understand; the "All documentation in Markdown format" is obviously met because everything that I have done and met in my website are written down here in the "README.md" so when marking my work, a person/the person who is marking, can read about what I have done and why I have done that thing; as said before the "easy to understand, easy to access anywhere, can be access from any device" are met and that is because I have made the website based on these 3 requirements because in my opinion are 3 of the most important requirements that I had to met. 

# Client Requirements 
1. "Professional, presenting good images at company": is fulfil and that is because the website is designed to be professional and having good images of phone for the company,
2. "Accessibility": the "Accessibility" requirement is fulfilled because the website can be access anywhere and it can be used how you want.
3. "Performance": the "Performance" requirement was fulfilled and that is because the website has a good performance e.g. it loads fast, it has no problems and it can be accessed easier and fast.

# Visitor Requirement
1. "Colourful": did not meet the design/website and that is because my design idea of my website was to be mostly bland by using the white colour as background-colour (#ffffff) so that means that I could change the design however it did not seem professional if it had multiple colours (my design/website) so I have decided to not change it and leave it mostly bland. By using pictures, videos and buttons I was able to give some colour at the website however it is not enough to be called "colourful".
2. "Images of phones": the "Images of phones" requirement is met and that is because the website is about the company and that means that the website would have a good amount of pictures of phones and other accessories for phones.
3. "Loads quickly": the "loads quickly" requirement is met and that is because the website was coded to become a fast and easy to use website meaning that I have put time into searching and testing multiple coding to see which one would be better for this idea of being fast and easy.
4. "Easy to navigate": the "easy to navigate" requirement, as said before, is met and that is because the website was coded and tested multiple times to make the website fast and easy to use in every way an example can be using the navbar.
5. "Propotion of the website" : the "proportion of the website" is met and that is because the website was made by taking in consideration the fact that I had to do a double design website and when I have put something in my website then I would convert the "thing" that I have added into my website to something that would fit the pc design and the phone design.
6. "Easy to understand": the "easy to understand" is met because already from the design idea one of the most important requirements for me was the "easy to understand" so I have made my website based on that requirement.
7. "Easy to access for everyone":the "easy to access for everyone" requirement is one of the most important requirement for me and that is because I have designed my website to be able to access however the user decided and that is because if the user wants to use a smartphone than he can and that is because the website would "shrink" to make the website easier to use on smartphone.

# Developer Requirements
1. "Clean, well-commented source code": the "Clean, well-commented source code" requirement is well met and that is because the code is a easy to read and understand coding that anyone can understand.
2. "All documentation in Markdown format":  the "All documentation in Markdown format" is obviously met because everything that I have done and met in my website are written down here in the "README.md" so when marking my work, a person/the person who is marking, can read about what I have done and why I have done that thing.
3. "Easy to understand, easy to access anywhere and can be access from any device": as said before the "easy to understand, easy to access anywhere, can be access from any device" are met and that is because I have made the website based on these 3 requirements because in my opinion are 3 of the most important requirements that I had to met. 






## Why did I choose the first design to the "different design"?
When I started developing my website I have decided to work on my first design (that one that you can see on my website) over the "different design" that I have created and the reason of this was because I have tried to test both designs to see which one was "better" meaning in the coding part and in the website part and my conclusion was that, my first design was easier and better in the website part so I decided to continue with the first design and "leave" the different design however I took inspiration from the "different design" and adapt it to the first design.

## What I have changed since my initials design idea to my final ideas?
 A lot of changes were made throught the making of this website. Most of them were design and those changes were made because of multiple reasons e.g. one example was because I could not code or because I had another idea for and one example of this can be the home page which on the initial design there were images below the “buttons” associated with the page, however this idea was changed, and I have decided to put videos instead. 

Another example of changing the code because the idea changed was the phones/phone cases/chargers/headphones pages because they all have the same design and that was from the initial idea however the title of the page of each of them was changed because initialy the ida was to put the title on top of the page however I changed my mind and put it below the nav bar and making them a “button” even thought it is more a title than a button.

The deal page was changed multiple times because of multiple reasons but the most important was that I changed my mind. Initially the design for the deal was meant to have pictures horizontally however after multiple ideas, I have taken the idea to put them vertically because it would be a different design from all the pages and also because if done so then the user/visitor can see better the deals.

The about us page was changed by the initial idea. The initial idea of the page was that it had hyperlinks to different pages such as events policy used and terms of use however after some time I realized that the page was not only about that but also about the company so I decided to change it into a page where it will say things about the company. 
The next page that I am going to talk about is the contact info page. The intial design of the page had multiple thing in it such as email, service number, address, custom service number, and phone number; however I have changed the design and I have only put things such as the official name of the company, email address and the telephone number. 

However in the contact info page I have added a page called form in which I have made a page that the user/visitor can do a feedback and send it to the company. In the form page there is a form that the user has to complete such as the name of the user, email address and the text meaning the feedback. When submitting the form it would say: “Thank you _________. Your form has been successfully submitted. We will get back to you as soon as possible.” meaning that the form is being submitted and the company would see your feedback.




### Feedback

1. Client 1 (Glen) 

> Right? First and foremost, a website is kinda bland not a lot of colour and the navigation by sort of OK but slightly mess but I can get up. First off the homepage is OK but needs more sorting out. Like, for instance, some of the videos are not in the middle of the subheadings have different types of videos they when I go to different pages. I can see different types of phones byjt only one type of phone. But there are so many choices for this type of phones specially with cases charges and headphones. S that I don't have a mind but really good. The above terraces nicere simple but needs more work on it. The contact info is. 
Alright, still planned. But needs more work. Nausea has a little time of set by oh forms. There is a phones I didnid1878 t know, but the problem is there is no await thereid1878 s yeah, itid1878 s nice and simple, but it needs more decorating. The Thai website even that is a good website. 

With this feedback given by Glen I will make some change that also I think they should be as he said. One of the things that he said to change was the videos that were not in the middle of the page and I also agree with him because even if it a changed idea they should "go with the flow of the website" so I will change to put the videos in the middle of the pages. With this said, I believe Glen was right about the idea of the videos because the website itself looks unbalanced meaning that multiple things are in order (should be in the middle) and some are not such as the videos meaning that the website would feel unbalanced/unequal, in other words: not right.

Another thing that Glen talked about was the tile. Glen said (I agree with him) that the title is too small and it is not in the middle. I will change that to make it bigger and to place it to the best place of the page. I have done the changing size however I have not changed the place where the title is and that is because in my opinion it is already in the best place that the title can be. As for the size, I have changed it because the initial design size for the tile it was 20px however after running tests and thanking to Glen's feedback, I have realised that the size was too small for a title so I have decided to change that after Glen's feedback and by doing so an user would recognise the title easier and the title itself would have a better impression on the user.

The last thing that glen talked about were the colors because in his opinion the design is too bland. I may change it into putting more colors into the website. However if I would put colours then it would be a small amount and that is because I want to keep up with my first design which has mostly a bland colour on the design. So with that said, I will continue mostly with my design and if I change my mind I will implement some colours but there would not be much colour.
