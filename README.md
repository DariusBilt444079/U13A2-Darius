 ### Design

+ The folder called wireframe pdf, if clicked on github, would give you access to a pdf about the wireframes made in assignment 2. Do not use the .drawio wireframes because it may not work.
+ If needed the justification design of the wire frames then check the wireframe pdf made before and on pages 1 to 3/4 (page 4 is just a one box that says some colours that may be used in the website).
+ The layout of the page in the pdf says at what device it is for (Landscape (horizontal)is for PC layout and Portrait (Vertical) layout is for smartphone).

### Unit 13 Assign 4

1. In the end the website that I created meets the user requirements that the course gave us, and this is because of multiple reasons, e.g. one of them can be the design which can be supported by multiple devices such as phone design and computer design, another one can be navigation because it has a nav bar which is used to navigate throught the page and with this the user/visitor can go from a page to the page that we wants. Another few features of the website that meets the user requirements are = it loads quick, it meets the purpose meaning that the website is about a company of phone and accessories, it is easy to understand, it is proportionate to the device design, it is very easy to understand, the design is simple and professional that meets and suits the purpose of the website.

When I started developing my website I have decided to work on my first design (that one that you can see on my website) over the "different design" that I have created and the reason of this was because I have tried to test both designs to see which one was "better" meaning in the coding part and in the website part and my conclusion was that, my first design was easier and better in the website part so I decided to continue with the first design and "leave" the different design however I took inspiration from the "different design" and adapt it to the first design.

 A lot of changes were made throught the making of this website. Most of them were design and those changes were made because of multiple reasons e.g. one example was because I could not code or because I had another idea for and one example of this can be the home page which on the initial design there were images below the “buttons” associated with the page, however this idea was changed, and I have decided to put videos instead. 
Another example of changing the code because the idea changed was the phones/phone cases/chargers/headphones pages because they all have the same design and that was from the initial idea however the title of the page of each of them was changed because initialy the ida was to put the title on top of the page however I changed my mind and put it below the nav bar and making them a “button” even thought it is more a title than a button.
The deal page was changed multiple times because of multiple reasons but the most important was that I changed my mind. Initially the design for the deal was meant to have pictures horizontally however after multiple ideas, I have taken the idea to put them vertically because it would be a different design from all the pages and also because if done so then the user/visitor can see better the deals.
The about us page was changed by the initial idea. The initial idea of the page was that it had hyperlinks to different pages such as events policy used and terms of use however after some time I realized that the page was not only about that but also about the company so I decided to change it into a page where it will say things about the company. 
The next page that I am going to talk about is the contact info page. The intial design of the page had multiple thing in it such as email, service number, address, custom service number, and phone number; however I have changed the design and I have only put things such as the official name of the company, email address and the telephone number. However in this page I have added a page called form in which I have made a page that the user/visitor can do a feedback and send it to the company. In the form page there is a form that the user has to complete such as the name of the user, email address and the text meaning the feedback. When submitting the form it would say: “Thank you _________. Your form has been successfully submitted. We will get back to you as soon as possible.” meaning that the form is being submitted and the company would see your feedback.




### Feedback

1. Client 1 (Glen) 

> Right? First and foremost, a website is kinda bland not a lot of colour and the navigation by sort of OK but slightly mess but I can get up. First off the homepage is OK but needs more sorting out. Like, for instance, some of the videos are not in the middle of the subheadings have different types of videos they when I go to different pages. I can see different types of phones byjt only one type of phone. But there are so many choices for this type of phones specially with cases charges and headphones. S that I don't have a mind but really good. The above terraces nicere simple but needs more work on it. The contact info is. 
Alright, still planned. But needs more work. Nausea has a little time of set by oh forms. There is a phones I didnid1878 t know, but the problem is there is no await thereid1878 s yeah, itid1878 s nice and simple, but it needs more decorating. The Thai website even that is a good website. 

With this feedback given by Glen I will make some change that also I think they should be as he said. One of the things that he said to change was the videos that were not in the middle of the page and I also agree with him because even if it a changed idea they should "go with the flow of the website" so I will change to put the videos in the middle of the pages. 

Another thing that Glen talked about was the tile. Glen said (I agree with him) that the title is too small and it is not in the middle. I will change that to make it bigger and to place it to the best place of the page.

The last thing that glen talked about were the colors because in his opinion the design is too bland. I will change that into putting more colors into the website.
